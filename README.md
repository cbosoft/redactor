# Redactor

Script for redacting text from an image.

Machine learning (Faster R-CNN) based processing searches for instances of text on an image and redacts by placing a box over the text on the image.

This can be used for removing potentially sensitive information from images prior to sharing publicly. The model is intended to be used to remove identifying information from microscope images, however it could be applied elsewhere e.g. to remove number plates from photographs, date/time/location information from CCTV images, etc.
